support each projects.

My name is _Lorenzo Citro_, I am the founder and [this is my LinkedIn

receipts in the cloud that you and your customers always have them available in case they are needed to request
assistance from the manufacturer of the defective goods.

**We developed also the App in React Native for Banca Generali Investor in B2B with Hotelnet**:
[link {% include icon-google-drive.html %}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtoKkr90XI1TT8Fz95xdmJVNWXbbfitwydiVFI_O-Qw/edit){:target="_blank"}

With Hotelnet we are working on the developments and maintenance of the **Banca Generali institutional website about
Luxembourg fund** [bgfml.lu](https://www.bgfml.lu/){:target="_blank"}.
**BGFML** is a Banca Generali site developed in MVC.net where there are all banking products with related information.
In addition to the products, it is also possible to download documents relating to the products in PDF format. All data
is stored in a SQL server database populated by importing an excel file from another desktop application developed in
dot net web form. The application is launched manually.

Returning to the website, the information can be consulted by navigating through the menu or by searching. The basic
information is completed by other information that can be reached via the web service exposed by Banca Generali. The
site, documents and product information are in multi-language (Italian / English).

We also built a mouse tracking system in Node.js for AI that collects data about the mouse pointer in the former 10

The site allows the modular management of each content page, reusing the same components in different viewing modes. For
example, the product categories structure is shown in preview on the home page as a slideshow, but some categories are 
shown in other pages in preview format. The content modification is unique but affects all derived modalities. Among the
functional customizations we have made the downloads of the files attached to the products, dependent on the user's
